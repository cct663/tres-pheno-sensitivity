Initially, I had ~190 boxes, but attrition (e.g., from being struck by orchard vehicles, rotting of plywood) gradually reduced that number to ~150. Directions of openings were initially south, but as grids evolved became random, although mostly pointing away from vegetation. Approx. equal numbers of smaller ""W"" boxes for swallows with 3.8-cm openings and 7000-cm3 volumes were interspersed with equal numbers of larger ""G"" boxes for starlings with 5.3-cm openings and 12,000-cm3 volumes, but failure to attract starlings and declining swallow occupancy led to me nailing pieces of wood that constrained G box openings to 3.8 cm, creating ""GW"" boxes. In 2015, ~ 50 new ""WN"" boxes using the Golondrinas design and 3/4"" plywood started to replace some of the deteriorating boxes."	Added	Dave Shutler	1
